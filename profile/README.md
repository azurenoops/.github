Azure NoOps is a flexible foundation of open-sourced projects that enables the US Department of Defense and other Public Sector customers to quickly develop and maintain opinionated, policy-driven, and self-service mission enclaves in their Azure environments.

Delivered as a collection of infrastructure as code (IaC) Terraform modules and example reference implementations, Azure NoOps is intended to empower organizations on their journey towards a continuous deployment and governance model for their cloud infrastructure.

## Quickstart Deployment - Terraform

While Azure NoOps can be used to build all sorts of useful solutions, a simple place to start is deploying a Mission Enclave platform.
You can use Azure NoOps to deploy [SCCA-compliant Mission Enclave](https://github.com/azurenoops/ref-scca-enclave-starter/blob/main/README.md) based on Microsoft's [SACA implementation guidance][saca]
