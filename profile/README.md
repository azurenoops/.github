Azure NoOps is a flexible foundation of open sourced projects that enables US Department of Defense and other Public Sector customers to quickly develop and maintain opinionated, policy-driven, and self-service enclaves in their Azure environments.

Delivered as a collection of infrastructure as code (IaC) module templates written and maintained in Tereform, the Azure NoOps is intended to empower organizations on their journey towards a continuous deployment and governance model for their cloud infrastructure.
